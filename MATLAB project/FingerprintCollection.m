function [fp_collection] = FingerprintCollection(filenames,hash,resize)
% FINGERPRINTCOLLECTION stores all of the image fingerprints from a list of
% image filenames so they can be quickly looked up for comparison.
%
% Inputs:
% ‚Ä¢ An ùëö-by-1 string array representing a list of image file names.
% ‚Ä¢ A character vector containing either 'AvgHash' or 'DiffHash'.
% ‚Ä¢ A character vector containing either 'Nearest' or 'Box'.
% Output:
% ‚Ä¢ An ùëö-by-1 cell array containing the fingerprint from each image file.
